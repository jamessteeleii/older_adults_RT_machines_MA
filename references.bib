  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Power training has been shown to be more effective than conventional resistance training for improving physical function in older adults; however, most trials have used pneumatic machines during training. Considering that the general public typically has access to plate-loaded machines, the effectiveness and safety of power training using plate-loaded machines compared to pneumatic machines is an important consideration. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of high-velocity training using pneumatic machines (Pn) versus standard plate-loaded machines (PL). METHODS: Independently-living older adults, 60years or older were randomized into two groups: pneumatic machine (Pn, n=19) and plate-loaded machine (PL, n=17). After 12weeks of high-velocity training twice per week, groups were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Primary outcomes were lower body power measured using a linear transducer and upper body power using medicine ball throw. Secondary outcomes included lower and upper body muscle muscle strength, the Physical Performance Battery (PPB), gallon jug test, the timed up-and-go test, and self-reported function using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and an online video questionnaire. Outcome assessors were blinded to group membership. RESULTS: Lower body power significantly improved in both groups (Pn: 19\%, PL: 31\%), with no significant difference between the groups (Cohen's d=0.4, 95\% CI (-1.1, 0.3)). Upper body power significantly improved only in the PL group, but showed no significant difference between the groups (Pn: 3\%, PL: 6\%). For balance, there was a significant difference between the groups favoring the Pn group (d=0.7, 95\% CI (0.1, 1.4)); however, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for PPB, gallon jug transfer, muscle muscle strength, timed up-and-go or self-reported function. No serious adverse events were reported in either of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumatic and plate-loaded machines were effective in improving lower body power and physical function in older adults. The results suggest that power training can be safely and effectively performed by older adults using either pneumatic or plate-loaded machines.},

The purposes of this study were: 1) to describe five-repetition STS test (FRSTST) performance (time) by adolescents and adults and 2) to determine the relationship of isometric knee extension strength (force and torque), age, gender, weight, and stature with that performance. Participants were 111 female and 70 male (14-85 years) community-dwelling enrollees in the NIH Toolbox Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function. The FRSTST was conducted using a standard armless chair. Knee extension force was measured using a belt-stabilized hand-held dynamometer; knee extension torque was measured using a Biodex dynamometer. The mean times for the FRSTST ranged from 6.0 sec (20-29 years) to 10.8 sec (80-85 years). For both the entire sample and a sub-sample of participants 50-85 years, knee extension strength (r = -0.388 to -0.634), age (r = 0.561 and 0.466), and gender (r = 0.182 and 0.276) were correlated significantly with FRSTST times. In all multiple regression models, knee extension strength provided the best explanation of FRSTST performance, but age contributed as well. Bodyweight and stature were less consistent in explaining FRSTST performance. Gender did not add to the explanation of FRSTST performance. Our findings suggest, therefore, that FRSTST time reflects lower limb strength, but that performance should be interpreted in light of age and other factors.},

  abstract = {Regular physical exercise has shown great benefits in preventing age-related functional losses and in improving the perception of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older people. To optimize these benefits, it would be interesting to evaluate what type of exercise is better. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of heavy-resistance training on mobility and HRQoL in older women. Forty healthy, untrained older women (60-75 years) were randomly assigned to three groups: circuit resistance training (CRT, n = 15), traditional resistance training (TRT, n = 15) or the control group (CG, n = 10). During the 12-week training period, both experimental groups performed training with heavy loads, twice a week. Before and after the training period, the Timed Up and Go test, as a proxy of mobility, and the perception of HRQoL were evaluated. TRT and CRT resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go test (-5.4 and -10.3\%, respectively; p {$<$} 0.05), but only the improvement after CRT was significantly greater than changes in the CG (p {$<$} 0.001). Only CRT elicited improvements in several dimensions of the perception of the HRQoL questionnaire, such as: physical functioning (13\%, p {$<$} 0.001), general health (8.1\%; p = 0.048), vitality (17.7\%; p {$<$} 0.001), role emotional (6.7\%; p = 0.044) and physical component summary (6.3\%; p = 0.001). The change in the CRT group was greater than in the CG (p {$<$} 0.001) in the physical functioning score. The present findings show that CRT might be a time- (and hence cost-) effective alternative to trigger multiple positive functional and psychological adaptations in older women.},

The concept of a generality of strength adaptation appears less supported in the literature. Objective: To elaborate on recommendations for strength assessment, providing a focus on the ``generality of strength'' and the ``generality of strength adaptation.''Design \& Methods: We reviewed the literature on a generality of strength. In addition, we examined the resistance training lit erature to provide evidence and discussion on a generality of strength adaptation. Results/Conclusions: The generality of strength adaptation, even across strength skills using the same muscle on related movements seems quite low. Although some studies show a weak generality of strength adaptation and others show no generality of strength adaptation, it appears that increases in strength diminish as the strength assessment becomes farther removed from the actual training stimulus.},

An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations. RESULTS: The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150-300\,min of moderate-intensity, or 75-150\,min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60\,min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold. CONCLUSION: These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018-2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.},

  abstract = {Progressive resistance training (RT) is one of the most effective interventions for reducing age-related deficits in muscle mass and functional capacity. PURPOSE: To compare four approaches to load progressions in RT for older adults to determine if an optimal method exists. METHODS: Eighty-two healthy community-dwelling older adults (71.8 {\textpm} 6.2 yr) performed 11 wk of structured RT (2.5 d{$\cdot$}wk) in treatment groups differing only by the method used to increase training loads. These included percent one repetition maximum (\%1RM): standardized loads based on a percentage of the one repetition maximum (1RM); rating of perceived exertion (RPE): loads increased when perceived difficulty falls below 8/10 on the OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale perceived exertion scale; repetition maximum (RM): loads increased when a target number of repetitions can be completed with a given load; repetitions in reserve (RiR): identical to RM except subjects must always maintain {$\geq$}1 "repetition in reserve," thus avoiding the possibility of training to temporary muscular failure. RESULTS: Multiple analyses of covariance indicated no significant between-group differences on any strength (chest press 1RM; leg press 1RM) or functional performance outcome (usual walking speed, maximum walking speed, 8-ft timed up-and-go, gallon jug transfer test, 30 s sit-to-stand). The RPE group found the exercise to be significantly more tolerable and enjoyable than subjects in the RiR, RM, and \%1RM groups. CONCLUSION: Given the RM, RPE, \%1RM, and RiR methods appear equally effective at improving muscular strength and functional performance in an older population, we conclude that the RPE method is optimal because it is likely to be perceived as the most tolerable and enjoyable, which are two important factors determining older adults' continued participation in RT.},

PARTICIPANTS: Overweight and obese (body mass index (BMI){$\geq$}27.0 kg/m2) sedentary men and women aged 65 to 79 (N=95). INTERVENTION: Five months of 4 d/wk of aerobic training (AT, n=40) or 3 d/wk of resistance training (RT, n=55). MEASUREMENTS: Physical function assessments: global measure of lower extremity function (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)), 400-m walk, peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak), and knee extensor strength. RESULTS: On average, both exercise interventions significantly improved physical function. For AT, there was a 7.9\% increase in VO2 peak; individual absolute increases varied from 0.4 to 4.3 mL/kg per minute, and four participants (13\%) showed no change or a decrease in VO2 peak. For RT, knee extensor strength improved an average of 8.1\%; individual increases varied from 1.2 to 63.7 Nm, and 16 participants (30\%) showed no change or a decrease in strength. Usual gait speed, 400-m walk time, chair rise time, and SPPB improved for the majority of AT participants and usual gait speed, chair rise time, and SPPB improved for the majority of RT participants, but there was wide variation in the magnitude of improvement. Only change in 400-m walk time with RT was related to exercise adherence (correlation coefficient=-0.31, P=.004). CONCLUSION: Despite sufficient levels of adherence to both exercise interventions, some participants did not improve function, and the magnitude of improvement varied widely. Additional research is needed to identify factors that optimize responsiveness to exercise to maximize its functional benefits in older adults.},

However, recent evidence questions this relationship and in this Green Banana article we argue the role of sarcopenia in mediating the age-associated loss of strength (which we will coin as dynapenia) does not deserve the attention it has attracted in both the scientific literature and popular press. Rather, we propose that alternative mechanisms underlie dynapenia (i.e., alterations in contractile properties or neurologic function), and urge that greater attention be paid to these variables in determining their role in dynapenia.},

Strength training interventions could be an important alternative tool for blood pressure control, however, consistent evidence and the most effective training protocol for this purpose are yet to be established. The current study used the Cochrane methodology to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of strength training on blood pressure in hypertensive patients. A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and World Health Organization databases. This review included controlled trials that evaluated the effect of strength training for 8~weeks or more in adults with arterial hypertension, published up to December 2020. Data are described and reported as the weighted mean difference of systolic and diastolic pressure and a 95\% confidence interval. Protocol registration: PROSPERO registration number CRD42020151269. A total of 14 studies were identified, including a combined total of 253 participants with hypertension. The meta-analysis showed that mean values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased significantly after strength training interventions. The strongest effect of strength training on decreasing blood pressure was observed in protocols with a moderate to vigorous load intensity ({$>$}\,60\% of one-repetition maximum-1RM), a frequency of at least 2 times per week, and a minimum duration of 8~weeks. We concluded that strength training interventions can be used as a non-drug treatment for arterial hypertension, as they promote significant decreases in blood pressure.},

The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in older adults are different than those associated with estrogen deprivation. Age-related bone loss involves a gradual and progressive decline, which is also seen in men. Markedly increased bone resorption leads to the initial fall in bone mineral density. With increasing age, there is also a significant reduction in bone formation. This is mostly due to a shift from osteoblastogenesis to predominant adipogenesis in the bone marrow, which also has a lipotoxic effect that affects matrix formation and mineralization. We review new evidence on the pathophysiology of age-related bone loss with emphasis upon the mechanism of action of current osteoporosis treatments. New potential treatments are also considered, including therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis in the elderly that focus on the pathophysiology and potential reversal of adipogenic shift in bone.},

Effects of different types of resistance training and detraining on functional capacity, muscle strength, and power in older women: A randomized controlled study. J Strength Cond Res 36(4): 984-990, 2022-Resistance training (RT) increases muscle strength, power, and functional capacity (FC) of older women. However, these benefits can be lost partially or totally with detraining. This study aimed to compare the effect of 20 weeks of different types of RT and 4 weeks of detraining on muscle strength, power, and FC in older women. Ninety-five older women were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups (strength endurance, power, absolute strength, and relative strength training) and 1 control group (CG). We assessed muscle strength (10RM test) and muscle power of the lower (countermovement jump) and upper limbs (medicine ball pitch). Functional capacity was assessed by the Senior Fitness Test, which comprises the following tests: 30-second arm curl, 30-second chair stand, back scratch, chair sit and reach, 8-foot up and go, and 6-minute walk. The experiment lasted 24 weeks (familiarization: 2 weeks; neural adaptation: 6 weeks; specific training: 12 weeks; and detraining: 4 weeks). Muscle strength, lower and upper limb power (all p {$<$} 0.05), 30-second arm curl, 30-second chair stand, 8-foot up and go, 6-minute walk (all p {$<$} 0.001), and lower limb flexibility (p = 0.002) improved in all experimental groups after training and CG showed no differences in any of these variables. After detraining, muscle strength, lower and upper limb power (p {$<$} 0.05 for all), and FC decreased in comparison to the end of RT (30-second arm curl, 30-second chair stand, 8-foot up and go, 6-minute walk, and lower limb flexibility, p {$<$} 0.05 for all). Although the FC of the subjects has been reduced after 4 weeks of detraining, it was maintained at higher levels in comparison to baseline. These results suggested that older women can be submitted to different types of RT to achieve improvements in general fitness.},

  abstract = {Objective: There is considerable interest in attaining muscular hypertrophy in recreational gym-\-goers, bodybuilders, older adults, and persons suffering from immunodeficiency conditions. Multiple review articles have suggested guidelines for the most efficacious training methods to obtain muscular hypertrophy. Unfortunately these included articles that inferred hypertrophy markers such as hormonal measurements, used older techniques that might not be valid (e.g. circumference) and failed to appropriately consider the complexity of training variables. Methods: The present commentary provides a narrative review of literature, summarising main areas of interest and providing evidence-\-based guidelines towards training for muscular hypertrophy. Conclusions: Evidence supports that persons should train to the highest intensity of effort, thus recruiting as many motor units and muscle fibres as possible, self-\-selecting a load and repetition range, and performing single sets for each exercise. No specific resistance type appears more advantageous than another, and persons should consider the inclusion of concentric, eccentric and isometric actions within their training regime, at a repetition duration that maintains muscular tension. Between set/exercise rest intervals appear not to affect hypertrophy, and in addition the evidence suggests that training through a limited range of motion might stimulate similar results to full range of motion exercise. The performance of concurrent endurance training appears not to negatively affect hypertrophy, and persons should be advised not to expect uniform muscle growth both along the belly of a muscle or for individual muscles within a group. Finally evidence suggests that short ({\textasciitilde}3 weeks) periods of detraining in trained persons does not incur significant muscular atrophy and might stimulate greater hypertrophy upon return to training.},

As such, resistance training has been referred to as medicine. However, participation and adherence remains low, with time constraints and perceived difficulty often cited as barriers to resistance training. With this in mind, we aimed to summarise the benefits which might be obtained as a product of a minimal dose approach. In this sense, participation in resistance training might serve as a prophylactic to delay or prevent the onset of biological aging. A short review of studies reporting considerable health benefits resulting from low volume resistance training participation is presented, specifically considering the training time, frequency, intensity of effort, and exercises performed. Research supports the considerable physiological and psychological health benefits from resistance training and suggests that these can be obtained using a minimal dose approach (e.g. {$\leq$}60min, 2d-wk-1), using uncomplicated equipment/methods (e.g. weight stack machines). Our hope is that discussion of these specific recommendations, and provision of an example minimal dose workout, will promote resistance training participation by persons who might otherwise have not engaged. We also encourage medical professionals to use this information to prescribe resistance exercise like a drug whilst having an awareness of the health benefits and uncomplicated methods.},

The search identified 5613 articles that were reviewed for physical assessment results stratified by sex and age. Maximal isometric and isokinetic 60{$^\circ\cdot$}s-1 knee extension (KE) and knee flexion (KF) contractions from 57 studies and 15\,283 subjects (N = 7918 females) had sufficient data reported on females and males for meaningful statistical evaluation to be undertaken.

Yet, there is an abrupt age-related decline in KE 60{$^\circ\cdot$}s-1 peak torque earlier in females (aged 41.8 years) than males (aged 66.7 years). In the assessment of KF peak torque, an age-related acceleration in strength loss was only identified in males (aged 49.3 years).

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical approaches to mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) are becoming more popular because of their flexibility and interpretability. Many randomized clinical trials report multiple outcomes with possible inherent correlations. Moreover, MTC data are typically sparse (although richer than standard meta-analysis, comparing only two treatments), and researchers often choose study arms based upon which treatments emerge as superior in previous trials. In this paper, we summarize existing hierarchical Bayesian methods for MTCs with a single outcome and introduce novel Bayesian approaches for multiple outcomes simultaneously, rather than in separate MTC analyses. We do this by incorporating partially observed data and its correlation structure between outcomes through contrast-based and arm-based parameterizations that consider any unobserved treatment arms as missing data to be imputed. We also extend the model to apply to all types of generalized linear model outcomes, such as count or continuous responses. We offer a simulation study under various missingness mechanisms (e.g., missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random) providing evidence that our models outperform existing models in terms of bias, mean squared error, and coverage probability then illustrate our methods with a real MTC dataset. We close with a discussion of our results, several contentious issues in MTC analysis, and a few avenues for future methodological development. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Ninety-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups; performing strength training one- (EX1), two- (EX2), or three- (EX3) times-per-week and a non-training control (CON) group. Whole-body strength training was performed using 2-5 sets and 4-12 repetitions per exercise and 7-9 exercises per session. All training groups attended supervised resistance training for 6 months. Body composition was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry and fasting blood samples were taken pre- and post-training. There were significant main effects of time for total fat mass (F = 28.12, P {$<$} 0.001) and abdominal fat mass (F = 20.72, P {$<$} 0.001). Pre- to post-study, statistically significant reductions in fat mass ({$\Delta$} = -1.3 {\textpm} 1.4 kg, P {$<$} 0.001, n = 26) were observed in EX3. Pre- to post-study reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration ({$\Delta$} = -0.38 {\textpm} 0.44 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1, P = 0.003, n = 19) were observed only in EX3, whereas a significant pre- to post-study increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration (0.14-0.19 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1) were observed in all training groups. Most variables at baseline demonstrated a significant (negative) relationship when correlating baseline values with their change during the study including: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (r = -0.583, P {$<$} 0.001), high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (r = -0.471, P {$<$} 0.001, and systolic blood pressure (r = -0.402, P = 0.003). The present study suggests that having more than two resistance training sessions in a week could be of benefit in the management of body composition and lipid profile. Nevertheless, interestingly, and importantly, those individuals with a higher baseline in systolic blood pressure, IL-6 and hs-CRP derived greatest benefit from the resistance training intervention, regardless of how many times-a-week they trained. Finally, the present study found no evidence that higher training frequency would induce greater benefit regarding inflammation markers or glycemic profile in healthy older adults.},

Free weight as well as machine training may offer an efficient option to improve physical performance, but the feasibility of these training regimes among elderly who require continuous institutional care is still open. AIMS: (1) To examine the feasibility of a 3-month machine vs. free weight strength training program in institutionalized older adults, and (2) to determine the effects on physical performance. METHODS: This study is a two-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled feasibility study within a nursing home. 45 institutionalized elderly men and women (aged 83.8\,{\textpm}\,8.0, 12 men, 33 women) were randomly divided into two groups. The two groups completed either a free weight (FWT) or machine training (MT) for 12~weeks, twice per week, 45-60~min per session, in an individually supervised format. Performance was assessed with the 11-step stair-climbing test, 10-m walk test, Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), 30-s Chair Rising Test (CRT), grip strength, body mass index. RESULTS: Indices of feasibility showed a recruitment and adherence rate of 53.6 and 87.5\%, respectively. 35.6\% of the participants dropped out after several weeks for personal reasons, illness, medical visits, or hospital stays. After the program no significant differences on motor performance were found between MT and FWT. However, there were significant improvements for both training groups on the TUG and the CRT. CONCLUSIONS: The present pilot study showed that it is feasible to conduct a strength training program in institutionalized participants. The more robust changes in motor function could serve as a basis for large randomized clinical trials.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and the criterion-related and construct validity of a 30-s chair stand as a measure of lower body strength in adults over the age of 60 years. Seventy-six community-dwelling older adults (M age = 70.5 years) volunteered to participate in the study, which involved performing two 30-s chair-stand tests and two maximum leg-press tests, each conducted on separate days 2-5 days apart. Test-retest intraclass correlations of .84 for men and .92 for women, utilizing one-way analysis of variance procedures appropriate for a single trial, together with a nonsignificant change in scores from Day 1 testing to Day 2, indicate that the 30-s chair stand has good stability reliability. A moderately high correlation between chair-stand performance and maximum weight-adjusted leg-press performance for both men and women (r = .78 and .71, respectively) supports the criterion-related validity of the chair stand as a measure of lower body strength. Construct (or discriminant) validity of the chair stand was demonstrated by the test's ability to detect differences between various age and physical activity level groups. As expected, chair-stand performance decreased significantly across age groups in decades--from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s (p {$<$} .01) and was significantly lower for low-active participants than for high-active participants (p {$<$} .0001). It was concluded that the 30-s chair stand provides a reasonably reliable and valid indicator of lower body strength in generally active, community-dwelling older adults.},

METHODS: Weight training-related injury data were analyzed from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. Sample weights provided by this organization calculated national estimates of weight training-related injuries from the 100-hospital sample. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2007, 25 335 weight training injuries were seen in US emergency departments, correlating to an estimated 970 801 injuries nationwide. Patients' mean age was 27.6 years (range, 6-100 years); 82.3\% were male. The upper trunk (25.3\%) and lower trunk (19.7\%) were the most commonly injured body parts. The most common diagnosis was sprain/strain (46.1\%). The most common mechanism of injury was weights dropping on the person (65.5\%). A large number of injuries occurred with free weights (90.4\%). Males had a larger proportion of upper trunk injuries (26.8\%; injury proportion ratio [IPR], 1.45; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-1.57; P {$<$}.001) than females (18.4\%). Females had a larger proportion of foot injuries (22.9\%; IPR, 2.09; 95\% CI: 1.93-2.26; P {$<$}.001) than males (11.0\%). Persons 12 years and younger had a larger proportion of hand (37.9\%; IPR, 2.08; 95\% CI: 1.76-2.46; P {$<$}.001) injuries than persons 13 years or older (18.2\%). Persons 55 years and older were injured more when using machines (18.2\%; IPR, 1.96; 95\% CI: 1.47-2.61, P {$<$}.001) than persons 54 years and younger (9.3\%). Persons using free weights sustained a greater proportion of fractures/dislocations (23.6\%; IPR, 2.44; 95\% CI: 1.92-3.09; P {$<$}.001) than persons using machines (9.7\%). CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to drive development of targeted, age- and gender-specific, evidence-based injury prevention strategies to decrease injury rates among weight training participants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance training with pneumatic machines attenuates the age-associated loss in muscle strength and function in older adults. However, effectiveness of scaled-up pneumatic machine resistance training in the community is not known. We evaluated the effectiveness of a multi-site community-delivered 12-week pneumatic machine resistance programme (Gym Tonic (GT)) on muscle strength and physical function in older adults. METHODS: Three hundred eighteen community-dwelling older adults aged {$\geq$}65\,years were randomized into 12-week (twice/week) coach-supervised-community-based-GT-programme(n~=\,168) and wait-list control groups(n~=\,150). After 12\,weeks, the intervention group continued with GT-training and the control group received supervised-GT-programme for further 12\,weeks (partial-crossover-design). Fried frailty score, lower-extremity muscle strength and physical function (i.e., fast and habitual gait-speed, balance, repeated-chair-sit-to-stand, short physical performance battery (SPPB)) were determined at baseline, 12 and 24\,weeks. Analysis adopted a modified-intention-to-treat-approach. RESULTS: After 12\,weeks, lower-extremity muscle strength improved by 11-26\%(all p\,{$<~$}0.05) and fast gait-speed improved by 7\%(p~=\,0.008) in GT-intervention group(n~=\,132) than controls(n~=\,118), regardless of frailty status. Other physical function performance did not differ between control and intervention groups after 12\,weeks (all p~{$>$}\,0.05). Frailty score improved by 0.5 in the intervention but not control group(p~=\,0.004). Within the intervention group, lower-extremity muscle strength and physical function outcomes improved at 24\,weeks compared with baseline (all p~{$<$}\,0.001). Within controls, lower-extremity muscle strength, SPPB, repeated-chair-sit-to-stand and fast gait-speed improved post-GT (24-week) compared to both pre-GT (12-week) and baseline. Programme adherence was high in intervention [0-12-weeks,90\%(SD,13\%); 12-24-weeks,89\%(SD,17\%)] and control [12-24-weeks,90\%(SD,19\%)] groups. CONCLUSION: Community-delivered GT resistance training programme with pneumatic machines has high adherence, improves muscle strength and fast gait-speed, and can be effectively implemented at scale for older adults. Future studies could examine if including other multi-modal function-specific training to complement GT can achieve better physical/functional performance in power, balance and endurance tasks.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyse the effects that long-term progressive resistance training interventions performed on weight machines have on sarcopenia (European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People) and how the interventions are composed. In total, 779 articles published between 2000 and 2020 were scanned (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) and 14 randomised controlled trials were included within the review. Populations, interventions, control groups and outcomes were analysed. Subsequent meta-analysis (10 studies, 902 participants) revealed that the time needed in a chair-stand-test, as an indicator for leg strength, was predominantly reduced, whereas grip strength remained unchanged after the interventions. Data concerning the effects of machine-based progressive resistance training on muscle quantity were insufficient for meta-analysis. Physical performance measured by undergoing the Timed-Up-and-Go-test, gait speed test, Short Physical Performance Battery and 6~min-walk-test improved significantly as well. The quality of evidence (GRADE) in the analysed studies was low or moderate. In summary, machine-based progressive resistance training has the potential to reverse sarcopenia in the oldest old, as reflected by enhanced muscle strength and physical performance. The systematic review revealed promising initial results for muscle quantity.},

Due to the aging process, muscle mass decreases and balance abilities are reduced. One major criticism of former interventions is that implemented resistance and balance exercises were not associated with movements needed in older adults' everyday life. The Functional Movement Circle for older adults (FuMoC) includes the combination of three aspects: resistance, balance, and movements of everyday life. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of training in the FuMoC with those of other training programs. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three intervention groups (IG1: FuMoC; IG2: resistance and balance training; IG3: coordination training) with a training period of 6~months and one inactive control group (CG) was conducted. At baseline (T1), after three (T2) and six (T3) months, parameters of strength (isometric strength measurement and One-Repetition Maximum test in leg and chest press) and mobility-related activities (gait analysis, Multisurface Obstacle Test for Older Adults (MSOT), Chair Rise Test (CRT), Timed Up \& Go Test (TUG), Maximum Step Length Test (MSLT)) were assessed as primary outcomes. Data of 78 (43 males, 35 females) older adults were analyzed (mean age: 68.4~years). Significant (p~{$<~$}0.05) interactions between time and group were observed in most of the primary outcomes.

AIM: This study investigated the link between improved neuromuscular performance and functional capacity after a 12-week resistance training period in untrained healthy older individuals. METHODS: Fifteen older men and women (60-71~years) adhered to a 4-week control period, followed by 12~weeks of non-linear resistance training for the lower limbs. Maximum dynamic leg press strength (1-RM), maximum isometric knee extension torque and rate of torque development (RTD) were evaluated at -~4, 0, 4, 8, and 12~weeks, and muscle activity was assessed at 0, 4, 8, and 12~weeks. Functional capacity tests (chair rise, stair ascent and descent, and timed up and go) were performed at -~4, 0, and 12~weeks. RESULTS: No changes occurred during the control period, but the group increased their 1-RM strength (from 142\,{\textpm}\,53 to 198\,{\textpm}\,43~kg, p\,=\,0.001), which was accompanied by an increase in vastus lateralis activation (p\,=\,0.008) during the intervention. Increase was observed at all RTD time intervals at week 8 (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Significant improvements in all the functional capacity tests were observed at week 12 (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). DISCUSSION: Despite the expected increase in strength, RTD, muscle activity, and functional capacity, there was no significant relationship between the changes in neuromuscular performance and functional capacity. While resistance training elicits various positive improvements in healthy older individuals, actual strength gain did not influence the gain in functional capacity. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the exact cause that improved the functional capabilities during resistance training are currently unknown.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults experience considerable muscle and bone loss that are closely interconnected. The efficacy of progressive resistance training programs to concurrently reverse/slow the age-related decline in muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify concomitant changes in lower-body muscle strength and BMD in older adults following a progressive resistance training program and to determine how these changes are influenced by mode (resistance only vs. combined resistance and weight-bearing exercises), frequency, volume, load, and program length. METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published in English before 1 June, 2021. Randomized controlled trials reporting changes in leg press or knee extension one repetition maximum and femur/hip or lumbar spine BMD following progressive resistance training in men and/or women\,{$\geq$}\,65~years of age were included. A random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression determined the effects of resistance training and the individual training characteristics on the percent change (∆\%) in muscle strength (standardized mean difference) and BMD (mean difference). The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 2.0) and Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty studies were identified and 14 were included. Progressive resistance training increased muscle strength (∆ standardized mean difference\,=\,1.1\%; 95\% confidence interval 0.73, 1.47; p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001) and femur/hip BMD (∆ mean difference\,=\,2.77\%; 95\% confidence interval 0.44, 5.10; p\,=\,0.02), but not BMD of the lumbar spine (∆ mean difference\,=\,1.60\%; 95\% confidence interval\,-\,1.44, 4.63; p\,=\,0.30). The certainty for improvement was greater for muscle strength compared with BMD, evidenced by less heterogeneity (I2\,=\,78.1\% vs 98.6\%) and a higher overall quality of evidence. No training characteristic significantly affected both outcomes (p\,{$>$}\,0.05), although concomitant increases in strength and BMD were favored by higher training frequencies, increases in strength were favored by resistance only and higher volumes, and increases in BMD were favored by combined resistance plus weight-bearing exercises, lower volumes, and higher loads. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive resistance training programs concomitantly increase lower-limb muscle strength and femur/hip bone mineral density in older adults, with greater certainty for strength improvement. Thus, to maximize the efficacy of progressive resistance training programs to concurrently prevent muscle and bone loss in older adults, it is recommended to incorporate training characteristics more likely to improve BMD.},

  abstract = {Muscle strength declines {$\sim$}3\% per year after the age of 70. Resistance training guidelines for older adults are often based on free-weight and machine exercises, which may be inaccessible and lack carryover to activities of daily living. We tested the hypothesis that resistance training adaptations in older adults are task-specific. Thirty adults (8 males, 22 females; mean age = 71 years) were randomly assigned to participate in 6~weeks of supervised, high-intensity resistance training (twice per week) utilizing free-weight and machine exercises (traditional) versus functional activities that were overloaded with a weighted vest (functional). Participants were thoroughly familiarized with the exercises and testing prior to beginning the study. Major outcome measures included assessments of functional performance, five-repetition maximum strength, isometric knee extensor force, and quadriceps muscle size. Physical activity and nutrition were monitored. The study results demonstrate that the magnitude of improvement within a given outcome was largely dependent on group assignment, with greater improvements in gait speed and the timed-up-and-go in the functional group, but 2-3{\texttimes} greater five repetition maximum strength improvements for the trap bar deadlift, leg press, and leg extension following traditional resistance training. Both groups showed improvements in isometric knee extensor force and muscle size, suggesting that some aspects of the observed adaptations were generic, rather than specific. Overall, these novel findings suggest that, among older adults, 1) resistance training adaptations exhibit a high degree of task specificity and 2) significant improvements in functional outcomes can be achieved with the use of a weighted vest.},

The EG performed two to three sets of 12-15 repeats of leg press, knee extension, and knee flexion exercises, 2 days/week for 6 weeks. Before and after training, lower body one repetition maximum (1RM), functional performance tests, quadriceps femoris muscle thickness (MT), and muscle quality (MQ) (1RM and quadriceps MT quotient) were assessed. After training, only the EG showed significant improvements in 1RM (p {$<$} 0.05), 30-s sit-to-stand (p {$<$} 0.001), and 8 foot up-and-go (p {$<$} 0.001). In addition, only in the EG, significant increases in all quadriceps femoris MT measurements (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris) (p {$\leq$} 0.05), and MQ (p {$<$} 0.001) were demonstrated. No changes were observed in the CG. Furthermore, there were significant associations between individual changes in MQ and corresponding changes in 30-s sit-to-stand (r = 0.62, p {$<$} 0.001), and 8 foot up-and-go (r = -0.71, p {$<$} 0.001).

The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -0.81), gait speed (r = -0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = -0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient's ability to go outside alone safely. These data suggest that the timed "Up \& Go" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We compared the effects of eccentrically biased (EB) and conventional (CONV) resistance training on muscle architecture, one-repetition maximum (1RM), isometric strength, isokinetic force-velocity characteristics, functional capacity, and pulse wave velocity in older men and women. METHODS: Twenty-eight older adults participated in the study (mean {\textpm} SD: age = 68 {\textpm} 5 yr). Of these, 13 were allocated to a waitlist control, 10 of whom progressed to training (CONV, n = 12; EB, n = 13). Training was twice a week for 16 wk. EB involved three sets of 10 concentric lifts at 50\% of 1RM with the eccentric portion of repetitions performed unilaterally, alternating between limbs with each repetition. CONV involved two sets of 10 repetitions at 75\% of 1RM. EB and CONV were matched for total work. Isokinetic knee extensor strength was assessed across a range of velocities (0-360{$^\circ\cdot$}s(-1)). Functional capacity was assessed via a 6-m fast walk test, a timed up and go test, stair climb and descent power test, and vertical jump test. Vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius medialis architecture were assessed using ultrasonography. RESULTS: Both EB and CONV improved 1RM ({$\Delta$} 23\%-35\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Compared to the control group, both training regimens improved 6-m fast walk ({$\Delta$} 5\%-7\%, P {$<$} 0.01) and concentric torque at 60 and 120{$^\circ\cdot$}s(-1) ({$\Delta$} 6\%-8\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Significant improvements were evident in EB for isometric and concentric torque at 240 and 360{$^\circ\cdot$}s(-1) ({$\Delta$} 6\%-11\%, P {$<$} 0.05), vastus lateralis thickness ({$\Delta$} 5\%, P {$<$} 0.05), and stair climb ({$\Delta$} 5\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Timed up and go ({$\Delta$} 5\%, P {$<$} 0.01), stair descent ({$\Delta$} 4\%, P {$<$} 0.05), and vertical jump ({$\Delta$} 7\%, P {$<$} 0.01) improved in CONV. Pulse wave velocity, pennation angle, and fascicle length remained unchanged in both training groups. CONCLUSIONS: EB seems superior to CONV at increasing torque at high contraction velocities, whereas CONV seems more effective at improving some functional performance measures and vertical jump. This has important implications for preserving functional capacity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of physical fitness and function on older adults in two programs of supervised exercise activity: resistance training and aerobic exercise. METHODS: This study is a randomized, prospective clinical trial composed of sedentary elderly people who did not have contraindications to exercise. Participants were divided into two groups: group one performed 6 exercises of resistance training twice a week, and group two participated in walking activity for 30 minutes twice a week. Functional assessment (time 0, 6 and 12 months) was measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (time to sit or stand, gait speed, and balance), flexibility test, and the six-minute walking test. We randomly selected 96 patients: 46 in the Resistance Training Group and 50 in the Aerobic Exercise Group. In the Resistance Training Group, 46 attended the first assessment and 20 attended until the third section. In the Aerobic Exercise Group, 50 attended the first assessment and 12 attended until the third assessment. RESULTS: Mean age was 68.8 years in the Resistance Training Group and 69.1 years in the Aerobic Exercise Group. The Resistance Training Group showed improvement in the sit/stand (p = 0.022), balance with feet in a row (p = 0.039) and queued (p = 0.001). The second showed a statistical difference in speed and balance with the feet lined up and the feet together (p = 0.008; p = 0.02; and p = 0.043, respectively). Concerning flexibility, the Resistance Training Group had improvement (p = 0.001), whereas in the Aerobic Exercise Group, no significant difference was seen (p = 0.359). Both groups had improvement in the six-minute walking test, but no significant improvement was seen in the Aerobic Exercise Group (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Both groups showed improvement in physical fitness. No statistical difference was seen when groups was compared in the short physical performance battery, flexibility, and six-minute walking test.},

SETTING: Aerobics centre longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: 8762 men aged 20-80. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality up to 31 December 2003; muscular strength, quantified by combining one repetition maximal measures for leg and bench presses and further categorised as age specific thirds of the combined strength variable; and cardiorespiratory fitness assessed by a maximal exercise test on a treadmill. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 18.9 years, 503 deaths occurred (145 cardiovascular disease, 199 cancer). Age adjusted death rates per 10,000 person years across incremental thirds of muscular strength were 38.9, 25.9, and 26.6 for all causes; 12.1, 7.6, and 6.6 for cardiovascular disease; and 6.1, 4.9, and 4.2 for cancer (all P{$<$}0.01 for linear trend). After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, baseline medical conditions, and family history of cardiovascular disease, hazard ratios across incremental thirds of muscular strength for all cause mortality were 1.0 (referent), 0.72 (95\% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.90), and 0.77 (0.62 to 0.96); for death from cardiovascular disease were 1.0 (referent), 0.74 (0.50 to 1.10), and 0.71 (0.47 to 1.07); and for death from cancer were 1.0 (referent), 0.72 (0.51 to 1.00), and 0.68 (0.48 to 0.97). The pattern of the association between muscular strength and death from all causes and cancer persisted after further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness; however, the association between muscular strength and death from cardiovascular disease was attenuated after further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness. CONCLUSION: Muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with death from all causes and cancer in men, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential confounders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefits of aerobic exercise are well-studied; there is no consensus on the association between resistance training and major adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address this issue. DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched for randomized trials and cohort studies that evaluated the association between resistance training and mortality and cardiovascular events. Two investigators screened the identified abstracts and full-texts independently and in duplicate. Cochrane tools were used to assess the risk of bias. We calculated hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using random effect models. RESULTS: From the 1430 studies identified, 11 (one randomized trial and 10 cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, totaling 370,256 participants with mean follow-up of 8.85 years. The meta-analysis showed that, compared with no exercise, resistance training was associated with 21\% (hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval (CI)), 0.79 (0.69-0.91)) and 40\% (hazard ratio (95\% CI), 0.60 (0.49-0.72)) lower all-cause mortality alone and when combined with aerobic exercise, respectively. Furthermore, resistance training had a borderline association with lower cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio (95\% CI), 0.83 (0.67-1.03)). In addition, resistance training showed no significant association with cancer mortality. Risk of bias was low to intermediate in the included studies. One cohort study looked at the effect of resistance training on coronary heart disease events in men and found a 23\% risk reduction (risk ratio, 0.77, CI: 0.61-0.98). CONCLUSION: Resistance training is associated with lower mortality and appears to have an additive effect when combined with aerobic exercise. There are insufficient data to determine the potential beneficial effect of resistance training on non-fatal events or the effect of substituting aerobic exercise with resistance training.},

METHODS: 42 older men and women (71.3~{\textpm}~6.6 years) were randomized to lower extremity HSPT (n~=~28) or control (CON; n~=~14) (Analysis 1) for 12~weeks. A second analysis (Analysis 2) allocated HSPT into high-velocity (n~=~14) or low-velocity (n~=~14) based on a limb movement speed above or below the median average velocity during the 12-week HSPT intervention. Habitual gait speed, maximal gait speed, timed up-and-go, and the short physical performance battery were measured at baseline and 12~weeks. Change scores were compared between HSPT and CON (Analysis 1), and high-velocity, low-velocity, and CON (Analysis 2) using ANCOVA. Statistical significance was accepted at p~{$<~$}0.05. RESULTS: Analysis 1 There were no group differences in habitual gait speed, maximal gait speed, or timed up-and-go between HSPT and CON (all p~{$>~$}0.05). Short physical performance battery was greater in HSPT (0.96~{\textpm}~0.19) compared to CON (0.10~{\textpm}~0.26; p~=~0.01). Analysis 2 There were no group differences in the change in habitual GS (p~=~0.33) among high-velocity, low-velocity and CON. There were significant group differences in the change in maximal GS (p~=~0.007), timed up-and-go (p~=~0.03), and short physical performance battery (p~=~0.03). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in self-selected maximal limb velocity during HSPT in older adults. In the present cohort, an average limb velocity of 0.88~m/s during HSPT was necessary to ensure optimal improvement in functional performance for older adults, but this threshold will need further investigation.},

Participants were tested before and after a 4-week control period and then assigned to a 12-week HVRT intervention. Investigated outcomes included ultrasound-derived muscle thickness and quality, maximal dynamic strength (1RM), maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), and muscle activation (sEMG), as well as muscle power and functional performance. After the intervention, quadriceps muscle thickness, 1RM, and sEMG improved in all three groups (all p\,{$<$}\,0.05), whereas muscle quality improved only in middle-aged and older participants (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001), and MVIC only in middle-aged and mobility-limited older adults (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). With a few exceptions, peak power improved in all groups from 30-90\% 1RM (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) both when tested relative to pre-training or post-training 1RM workloads (all p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Both mobility-limited older adults and older adults improved their short physical performance battery score (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Chair stand, stair climb, maximal gait speed, and timed up-and-go performance, on the other hand, improved in all three groups (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), but no change was observed for habitual gait speed and 6-min walk test performance. Overall, our results demonstrate that a HVRT intervention can build a stronger foundation in middle-aged individuals so that they can better deal with age-related impairments at the same time that it can mitigate already present physiological and functional impairments in older adults with and without mobility-limitation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle size and strength decrease with aging, and the resultant muscle weakness has been implicated in increased risk of falls in older adults. These falls have large economic and functional costs. METHODS: The purpose of this randomized, controlled study was to determine if an 8-week, 3-day per week intense (77.8 +/- 3.4\% of 1-repetition maximum [1RM]) strength training program could improve functional ability related to the risk of falling in subjects aged 61--87 years (mean 72, SD 6.3). Twelve strength-training-naive subjects performed two sets of 10 repetitions for six lower body exercises while 12 subjects served as nonintervention controls. Subjects were tested pre-, mid-, and postintervention for strength gain and on three tests of functional ability. RESULTS: Postintervention strength was significantly better (p {$<$}.017) in all training subjects across all exercises, and no injuries were reported as a result of either training or 1RM testing. After controlling for preintervention differences, repeated measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found a significant difference between experimental and nonintervention control subjects for postintervention maximal walking speed [F(1,19) = 5.03, p {$<$}.05]. There were no significant between-group differences for 1-leg blind balance time or 5-repetition sit-to-stand performance [F(1,19) =.082; F(1,19) =.068, respectively, p {$>$}.05]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that strength training alone does not appear to enhance standing balance or sit-to-stand performance in active, community-dwelling older adults but that it may improve maximal walking speed. The relationship between strength gain and risk of falls remains unclear. The data do reinforce the notion that intense strength training is a safe and effective way to increase muscle strength in this population.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the relationship between resistance training and all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews Registration Number CRD42019136654) was conducted. MEDLINE (OVID), Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, The Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS were searched from inception to June 6, 2021. Included studies reported resistance training as the exposure and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease-specific mortality, and/or cancer-specific mortality as outcome/s. Only studies conducted among nonclinical adult populations (aged {$\geq$}18 years) and written in English were included. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Compared with undertaking no resistance training, undertaking any amount of resistance training reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 15\% (RR of 6 studies=0.85; 95\% CI=0.77, 0.93), cardiovascular disease mortality by 19\% (RR of 4 studies=0.81; 95\% CI=0.66, 1.00), and cancer mortality by 14\% (RR of 5 studies=0.86; 95\% CI=0.78, 0.95). A dose-response meta-analysis of 4 studies suggested a nonlinear relationship between resistance training and the risk of all-cause mortality. A maximum risk reduction of 27\% was observed at around 60 minutes per week of resistance training (RR=0.74; 95\% CI=0.64, 0.86). Mortality risk reductions diminished at higher volumes. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the strongest evidence to date that resistance training is associated with reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer-specific mortality. More research is needed to determine whether any potential mortality benefits gained from resistance training diminish at higher volumes.},

SUBJECTS: Fifteen older adults with no history of falls (mean age=78 years, SD=6, range=65-85) and 15 older adults with a history of 2 or more falls in the previous 6 months (mean age=86.2 years, SD=6, range=76-95) participated. METHODS: Time taken to complete the TUG under 3 conditions (TUG, TUG with a subtraction task [TUGcognitive], and TUG while carrying a full cup of water [TUGmanual]) was measured. A multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function and logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The TUG was found to be a sensitive (sensitivity=87\%) and specific (specificity=87\%) measure for identifying elderly individuals who are prone to falls. For both groups of older adults, simultaneous performance of an additional task increased the time taken to complete the TUG, with the greatest effect in the older adults with a history of falls. The TUG scores with or without an additional task (cognitive or manual) were equivalent with respect to identifying fallers and nonfallers. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the TUG is a sensitive and specific measure for identifying community-dwelling adults who are at risk for falls. The ability to predict falls is not enhanced by adding a secondary task when performing the TUG.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isotonic exercise is the most common mode of strength training. Isotonic strength is often measured in the movement that was exercised, but isometric and isokinetic movements are also commonly used to quantify changes in muscular strength. Previous research suggests that increasing strength in one movement may not lead to an increase in strength in a different movement. Quantifying the increase in strength in a movement not trained may be important for understanding strength training adaptations and making recommendations for resistance exercise and rehabilitation programs. OBJECTIVE: To quantify changes in non-specific strength relative to a control. DESIGN: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis was conducted investigating the effects of isotonic strength training on isotonic and isokinetic/isometric strength. SEARCH AND INCLUSION: This systematic review was conducted in Google scholar, PubMed, Academic Search Premier, and MENDELEY. To be included in this review paper the article needed to meet the following criteria: (1) report sufficient data for our variables of interest (i.e., changes in isotonic strength and changes in isokinetic or isometric strength); (2) include a time-matched non-exercise control; (3) be written in English; (4) include healthy human participants over the age of 18~years; (5) the participants had to train and test isotonically; (6) the participants had to be tested isokinetically or isometrically on a device different from that they trained on; (7) the non-specific strength task had to test a muscle involved in the training (i.e., could not have trained chest press and test handgrip strength); and (8) the control group and the experimental group had to perform the same number of strength tests. RESULTS: We completed two separate searches. In the original search a total of 880 papers were screened and nine papers met the inclusion criteria. In the secondary search a total of 2594 papers were screened and three additional papers were added (total of 12 studies). The overall effect of resistance training on changes in strength within a movement that was not directly trained was 0.8 (Cohen's d) with a standard error of 0.286. This overall effect was significant (t\,=\,2.821, p\,=\,0.01) and the 95\% confidence interval (CI) is 0.22-1.4. The overall effect of resistance training on strength changes within a movement that was directly trained was 1.84 (Cohen's d) with a standard error of 0.296. This overall effect was significant (t\,=\,6.221, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and the 95\% CI is 1.23-2.4. CONCLUSION: The results of our meta-analysis suggest that strength increases in both the specific and non-specific strength tests. However, the smaller effect size associated with non-specific strength suggests that it will be difficult for a single study to meaningfully investigate the transfer of strength training adaptions.},

Recently, technology has been utilized to complement these clinical assessments to gain a more objective and detailed view of functionality. In the clinic and at home, technology is able to provide more information about patient performance and reduce subjectivity in outcome measures. The timed up and go (TUG) test is one such assessment recently instrumented with technology in several studies, yielding promising results toward the future of automating clinical assessments. Potential benefits of technological TUG implementations include additional performance parameters, generated reports, and the ability to be self-administered in the home. In this paper, we provide an overview of the TUG test and technologies utilized for TUG instrumentation. We then critically review the technological advancements and follow up with an evaluation of the benefits and limitations of each approach. Finally, we analyze the gaps in the implementations and discuss challenges for future research toward automated self-administered assessment in the home.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity (as defined by body mass index) has not been associated consistently with higher mortality in older adults. However, total body mass includes fat and muscle, which have different metabolic effects. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that greater muscle mass in older adults is associated with lower all-cause mortality. METHODS: All-cause mortality was analyzed by the year 2004 in 3659 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III who were aged 55 years or more (65 years if women) at the time of the survey (1988-1994). Individuals who were underweight or died in the first 2 years of follow-up were excluded to remove frail elders from the sample. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using bioelectrical impedance, and muscle mass index was defined as muscle mass divided by height squared. Modified Poisson regression and proportional hazards regression were used to examine the relationship of muscle mass index with all-cause mortality risk and rate, respectively, adjusted for central obesity (waist hip ratio) and other significant covariates. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, total mortality was significantly lower in the fourth quartile of muscle mass index compared with the first quartile: adjusted risk ratio 0.81 (95\% confidence interval, 0.71-0.91) and adjusted hazard ratio 0.80 (95\% confidence interval, 0.66-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the survival predication ability of relative muscle mass and highlights the need to look beyond total body mass in assessing the health of older adults.},

However, few studies have adequately examined the longitudinal time-course of strength adaptations to resistance training. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the time-course of strength development from minimal-dose resistance training in a large sample through retrospective training records from a private international exercise company. Methods: Data were available for analysis from 14,690 participants (60\% female; aged 48~{\textpm}~11~years) having undergone minimal-dose resistance training (1x/week, single sets to momentary failure of six exercises) up to 352~weeks ({\textasciitilde}6.8~years) in length. Linear-log growth models examined strength development over time allowing random intercepts and slopes by participant. Results: All models demonstrated a robust linear-log relationship with the first derivatives (i.e., changes in strength with time) trending asymptotically such that by {\textasciitilde}1-2~years strength had practically reached a "plateau." Sex, bodyweight, and age had minimal interaction effects. However, substantial strength gains were apparent; approximately {\textasciitilde}30-50\% gains over the first year reaching {\textasciitilde}50-60\% of baseline 6~years later. Conclusion: It is unclear if the "plateau" can be overcome through alternative approaches, or whether over the long-term strength gains differ. Considering this, our results support public health recommendations for minimal-dose resistance training for strength adaptations in adults.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis has become commonplace within sport and exercise science for synthesising and summarising empirical studies. However, most research in the field focuses upon mean effects, particularly the effects of interventions to improve outcomes such as fitness or performance. It is thought that individual responses to interventions vary considerably. Hence, interest has increased in exploring precision or personalised exercise approaches. Not only is the mean often affected by interventions, but variation may also be impacted. Exploration of variation in studies such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can yield insight into interindividual heterogeneity in response to interventions and help determine generalisability of effects. Yet, larger samples sizes than those used for typical mean effects are required when probing variation. Thus, in a field with small samples such as sport and exercise science, exploration of variation through a meta-analytic framework is appealing. Despite the value of embracing and exploring variation alongside mean effects in sport and exercise science, it is rarely applied to research synthesis through meta-analysis. We introduce and evaluate different effect size calculations along with models for meta-analysis of variation using relatable examples from resistance training RCTs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical function is shown to decline with age. However, how long-term strength training may attenuate the age-related limitation in functional tasks with various force demands is unclear. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we assessed maximal muscle strength, initial and late phase rate of force development (RFD), as well as 4 tests of functional performance in 11 strength-trained master athletes (MAs), 11 recreationally active older adults (AEs), 10 sedentary older adults (SOAs), and 9 moderately active young controls. Functional performance was divided into 2 categories: more force-demanding (chair-rising ability and stair-climbing power) and less force-demanding (habitual walking speed and 1-leg standing) tasks. RESULTS: MA exhibited 75\%, 45\%, and 26\% higher leg press maximal strength compared with SOA, AE, and young, respectively (P {$<$} .01). MA leg press RFD was not different from young, but was higher compared to AE and SOA during both the initial (0-50 ms: 104\%-177\%, P {$<$} .05) and late phase (100-200 ms: 37\%-52\%, P {$<$} .05) of muscle contraction. MA also showed better mean (SD) performance compared with AE and SOA (P {$<$} .05) in more force-demanding functional tasks; chair-rising ability (MA: 6.2 (1.2) seconds; AE: 8.6 (1.8) seconds; SOA: 9.7 (3.0) seconds; young: 6.5 (1.0) seconds) and stair-climbing power (MA: 701 (161) W; AE: 556 (104) W; SOA: 495 (116) W; young: 878 (126) W). No differences (mean (SD)) were observed between MA and AE in less force-demanding tasks, but both groups were superior (P {$<$} .05) compared with SOA in walking speed (MA: 1.49 (0.21) m{$\cdot$}s; AE: 1.56 (0.17) m{$\cdot$}s; SOA: 1.27 (0.22) m{$\cdot$}s; young: 1.62 (0.22) m{$\cdot$}s) and balance test completion (MA: 45\%; AE: 45\%; SOA: 0\%; young: 100\%). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that maintaining a high muscle force-generating capacity into older age is related to beneficial effects on functional performance, which may not be achieved with recreational activity, thus highlighting strength training as an important contribution to healthy aging.},

Eighty-one men and women acted as an intervention group while 22 acted as non-training controls (age range 64-75 y). Intervention training included super-sets (i.e., paired exercises, immediately performing the second exercises following completion of the first) with short rest intervals (30-60 s between sets) at an intensity of 50-60\% one-repetition maximum (1-RM) for 15-20 repetitions. Concentric leg press actions measured maximum strength (1-RM) and concentric peak power. Functional capacity was assessed by maximum speed walking tests (i.e., forward walk, backward walk, timed-up-and-go, and stair climb tests). Quadriceps muscle activation was assessed by surface electromyogram and twitch interpolation technique. Vastus lateralis cross-sectional area was measured by panoramic ultrasound. Compared to control, the intervention groups increased maximum strength (1-RM; men: 10 {\textpm} 7\% vs. 2 {\textpm} 3\%, women: 14 {\textpm} 9\% vs. 1 {\textpm} 6\% both P {$<$} 0.01) and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (men: 6 {\textpm} 7\% vs. -3 {\textpm} 6\%, women: 10 {\textpm} 10\% vs. 0 {\textpm} 4\% both P {$<$} 0.05).

  abstract = {Numerous research studies performed in "lab-gyms" with supervised training have demonstrated that simple, brief (20-30 min) resistance training protocols performed 2-3/week following the American College of Sports Medicine's guidelines positively affect risk factors associated with heart disease, cancers, diabetes, sarcopenia and other disabilities. For more than a decade, resistance training has been recommended for adults, particularly older adults, as a prime preventive intervention, and increasing the prevalence of resistance training is an objective of Healthy People 2010. However, the prevalence rate for resistance training is only estimated at 10-15\% for older adults, despite the leisure time of older adults and access to facilities in developed countries. The reasons that the prevalence rate remains low include public health policy not emphasising resistance training, misinformation, and the lack of theoretically driven approaches demonstrating effective transfer and maintenance of training to minimally supervised settings once initial, generally successful, supervised training is completed. Social cognitive theory (SCT) has been applied to physical activity and aerobic training with some success, but there are aspects of resistance training that are unique including its intensity, progression, precision, and time and place specificity. Social cognitive theory, particularly with a focus on self-regulation and response expectancy and affect within an ecological context, can be directly applied to these unique aspects of resistance training for long-term maintenance.},
